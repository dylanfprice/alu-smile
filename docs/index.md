# How to use this extension

1. Set up an account at [https://secure.actblue.com](https://secure.actblue.com).
2. Set up an ActBlue Express Profile and a Payment Method. You can find these under the Account dropdown in the upper righthand corner after logging in to ActBlue.
3. Install this extension. The default contribution is 10% of your order total, but you can change this to whatever you like in the extension preferences.
4. Next time you check out on Amazon.com, a checkbox will show up indicating how much will be donated to the Amazon Labor Union. You can uncheck the box to disable donations for an individual order.
5. _The first time you use this extension_: when you click "Place your order" a donation page will open up. If you are not signed in with your ActBlue Express account you will need to do that. Next you will need to select a payment method. Then if you are prompted to choose a donation amount click "Other" to reveal the prefilled amount from your order. Finally, submit the donation. If after submitting the donation you are prompted to sign in, do so.
6. The next time you use the extension, as soon as you click "Place your order" your donation will immediately be processed and your Amazon order will be submitted. A new tab will open confirming your donation, and your Amazon order confirmation will be available on the original tab.

Here's what it looks like in action after everything is set up:

# Philosophy

Adding a checkbox to the check out page reminds you that Amazon.com is not a machine--there are many real people behind every order. I have found it to be more motivating than donating separately, because beyond giving money you give yourself the opportunity to feel connected to other people and know that you care about their struggles.
